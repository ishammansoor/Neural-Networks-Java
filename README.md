# Neural-Networks-Java

In this project I wanted to get a deeper understanding of neural networks and how it works. 
I used java, and created a simple neural network using the sigmoid function and simple Neural 
Network. 


Looks backs: 
- the main issues was with back propogations, there was a lot of issues with the calculations and the derivatives and stuff. 
  After some tweaks I was able to get a pretty good output, like below: 

Input: [0.0, 0.0] -> Predicted Output: [0.0038363743858623343]
Input: [0.0, 1.0] -> Predicted Output: [0.9949547483718553]
Input: [1.0, 0.0] -> Predicted Output: [0.9949961200740051]
Input: [1.0, 1.0] -> Predicted Output: [0.007190666269275428]

Overall I learned a lot in this small project, like how to structure neural networks and how all the calculations add up to
fix learning pattern.
